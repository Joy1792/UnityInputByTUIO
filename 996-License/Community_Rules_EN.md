Community Rules

The 996.ICU repo is a community where everyone who wants to take part could openly communicate and share their opinions.

We wish everyone to speak their mind freely here. This, however, can also give rise to conflicts and arguments. In order to keep this open-source community a positive, civil, friendly, and safe space, we ask everyone to please respect, acknowledge, and follow the Community Rules.

We value each and every contributor to the open-source community. If you notice anything that may have violated the Community Rules, please contact us or the other members of the community.

Respecting each other
The 996.ICU community respects all contributors equally. You may encounter some different opinions that you may not agree with; we ask you to respect them as well. In order to foster an open and inclusive environment for everyone, please keep your words and behaviour respectful towards others at all times, especially:
 - Please do not post anything that includes contents of name calling, defamation, harassment, threats, sedition, obscenity, or pornography. For example, do not use vulgar or insulting language; do not spread hateful or intolerant speech based on someone else's ethnicity, race, nationality, sex, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, age, or physical disabilities; similarly, do not promote any organisations that disseminate such speech.
 - Please do not post anything that breaches anyone else's privacy. For example, do not publicise other people's phone numbers, email addresses, post addresses, or any other personal information.
 - Please do not post links to phishing or other malicious websites.
 - Please do not impersonate someone else, an organisation you do not represent, or any entity other than yourself.
 - Please do not spam anyone with repeated information or requests.
 - Please do not attempt to flood other people's opinions; do not spam identical or similar contents through the use of multiple smurf accounts, or by coordinating with others. 
 - Please refrain from swearing or personal attacks.
 - You may challenge other people's opinions or expertise, provided that your discussion is relevant to the current topic and is done in a respectful and mindful way.

No copyright violations
 - You should not infringe anyone else's copyright or other rights when posting contents and interacting with the members of this community. You should only post contents that you own or have the permission to use.


If you notice any behaviour or contents that violates the Community Rules, please use a pull request to contact members of this community (please no repeated pull requests for the same problem).
We will take appropriate measures in response; your contribution will help us build a better community! In the mean time, the Community Rules will be continuously refined as well.
